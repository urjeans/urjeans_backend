I'll help you create the database for the Urjeans project. Based on the project setup, we need to create a MySQL database named `urjeans_db`. Let me check the database schema first to understand what tables we need to create.

Read file: backend/db-schema.md
Based on the schema file, I'll guide you through creating the database step by step:

1. First, make sure MySQL is installed and running on your system. You can verify this by running:

```bash
mysql --version
```
I see that MySQL is not installed on your system. Here's what you need to do:

1. **Install MySQL**:
   Since you're on macOS, you can install MySQL using Homebrew. Here are the steps:

   ```bash
   # Install Homebrew if you don't have it
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   
   # Install MySQL
   brew install mysql
   
   # Start MySQL service
   brew services start mysql
   ```

2. **After installing MySQL**, you'll need to:
   - Set a root password when prompted during installation
   - Create a new user for the application (recommended for security)

3. **Create the database and tables**:
   Once MySQL is installed and running, you can create the database using the MySQL command line client:

   ```bash
   # Log in to MySQL (you'll be prompted for the password)
   mysql -u root -p
   ```

   Then, copy and paste these SQL commands (from the schema file):

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS urjeans_db;
   USE urjeans_db;

   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (
       id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       brand_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       colors VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       images TEXT NOT NULL,
       fabric VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       sizes VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       description TEXT,
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );

   -- Create indexes
   CREATE INDEX idx_brand_name ON products(brand_name);
   CREATE INDEX idx_created_at ON products(created_at);

   -- Insert sample data
   INSERT INTO products (brand_name, colors, images, fabric, sizes, description) VALUES
   ('Izmir', 'Blue,Black', '["url1.jpg","url2.jpg","url3.jpg"]', '98% Cotton, 2% Elastane', '28,30,32,34', 'Classic fit blue jeans with modern styling'),
   ('Powerful', 'Dark Blue,Light Blue', '["url4.jpg","url5.jpg"]', '100% Cotton', '30,32,34,36', 'Comfortable everyday wear jeans'),
   ('Zilver', 'Black,White', '["url6.jpg","url7.jpg","url8.jpg"]', '95% Cotton, 5% Spandex', '28,30,32', 'Slim fit trendy jeans');
   ```

4. **Create a database user** (recommended for security):
   After logging in as root, create a new user and grant privileges:

   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'urjeans_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_secure_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON urjeans_db.* TO 'urjeans_user'@'localhost';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

5. **Update your .env file**:
   After creating the database and user, update your `.env` file in the backend directory with the correct credentials:

   ```env
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=urjeans_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
   DB_NAME=urjeans_db
   PORT=3000
   ```

I see the issue. You're getting an "Access denied" error when trying to log in as root, which typically means one of two things:

1. Either the root password you entered is incorrect
2. Or the root user hasn't been properly set up yet

Since you just installed MySQL, it's likely that the root password hasn't been set up properly. Here's how we can fix this:

1. First, let's stop the MySQL service:

```bash
brew services stop mysql
```
2. Now, let's start MySQL in safe mode, which allows you to connect without a password:

```bash
mysql.server start --skip-grant-tables
```
3. Now, let's connect to MySQL without a password:

```bash
mysql -u root
```
Great! Now we're connected to MySQL. Let's set a new root password. In the MySQL prompt, run these commands:

```sql
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_new_password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Replace 'your_new_password' with a secure password of your choice. Make sure to remember this password!

After setting the password:

1. Exit MySQL by typing `exit` or pressing Ctrl+D
2. Stop MySQL:
```bash
mysql.server stop
```
3. Start MySQL normally:
```bash
brew services start mysql
```
4. Try connecting with your new password:
```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

Would you like me to help you execute these commands? Just let me know what password you'd like to set for the root user, and I'll help you set it up properly.

Remember: 
- Choose a strong password
- Make sure to save it somewhere secure
- You'll need this password later for database operations
- Never share your root password with anyone

Let me know once you've decided on a password, and I'll help you set it up!
