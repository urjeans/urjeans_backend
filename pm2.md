Great! Since you want to continue, hereâ€™s what you should do next for a production-ready deployment:

---

## 1. **Set Up a Production Process Manager (PM2)**

PM2 will keep your Node.js app running, restart it if it crashes, and make it easy to manage in production.

**Install PM2 globally:**
```sh
npm install -g pm2
```

**Start your backend with PM2:**
```sh
cd backend
pm2 start server.js --name urjeans-backend
```

**Set PM2 to auto-start on server reboot:**
```sh
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

---

## 2. **Configure a Reverse Proxy (nginx)**

nginx will forward HTTP/HTTPS requests to your Node.js app and handle SSL.

**Example nginx config:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```
- Replace `yourdomain.com` with your real domain.
- After editing, reload nginx:  
  ```sh
  sudo nginx -s reload
  ```

---

## 3. **Set Up SSL (HTTPS)**

**Recommended: Use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for free SSL.**

**On most systems:**
```sh
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx
```
- Follow the prompts to secure your domain.

---

## 4. **Set Up Monitoring**

- **PM2 Monitoring:**  
  ```sh
  pm2 monit
  ```
- **Log files:**  
  PM2 stores logs in `~/.pm2/logs/`
- For advanced monitoring, consider services like [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) or [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/).

---

## 5. **Security & Final Checks**

- Double-check your `.env` for strong secrets and correct production values.
- Make sure your firewall allows only necessary ports (80, 443).
- Test your API endpoints from outside your server (e.g., Postman, browser).
